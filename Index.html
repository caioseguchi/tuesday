                    Bob was left in abandoned house for several weeks when he was only a puppy, until one of the neighbours discovery him and inform us.
                    We brought him to the house, recovery fim from innutrition, gave a lot of love.
                    After two years he was fully recovery and adopted by a lovely boy and his family.

                    It was too dangerous for her to sand back to normal habitat. But we could find a lovely home for Tita.
